<h1>3.	Susan’s work on behalf of Dr. Michaels’ business is diverting her attention from meeting her own academic needs. Whose responsibility is it to insure that this does not happen? Is it ever appropriate for a graduate student to perform, on behalf of a faculty member, work that is not related to the student’s own academic work?</h1>

<p>
In our society, it is the trainee’s ultimate responsibility to insure that he or she is not diverted inappropriately from a productive and efficient path of professional advancement. However, "ultimate" responsibility should never be misinterpreted as "sole" responsibility. Institutions, departments, academic committees, advisers, mentors, and many others can and should give counsel and advocacy as the trainee progresses along a path of professional development. They should be ready to intercede at the first signs of faltering or diverted progress. For example, it should be departmental policy for advisers to meet regularly with the trainee to appraise and advise the trainee on his or her progress and to make sure that the best courses of action are being devised and acted on. In this case, it seems apparent that failsafe mechanisms should have been in place within the department to insure that responsibility for Susan’s progress wasn’t in the hands of a single individual.
<br>
<br>
It is unethical and unwise for a mentoring faculty member to place his or her own priorities above those of the student. It is unwise because the potential for exploitation, or the appearance of exploitation, is too great to ignore for the institution and the researcher. It is also possible that the process of cognitive dissonance could obscure the mentor’s ability to be aware of the potential for not fully placing the need for an effective trainee development process above his or her own priorities. When dealing with issues related to trainees, their best interests should always be the ethical guidepost. This is one of the reasons that having multiple mentors is usually the best option for trainees, allowing awareness and oversight from objective third parties.
<br>
<br>
That said, however, it is not uncommon for students to work for pay in areas outside their particular field of interest in the employ of faculty members who are not involved in the trainee’s academic development. As long as it is understood that the arrangement is purely financial, then it is appropriate.
