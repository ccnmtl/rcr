<h1>7.	Should Susan take any further actions with regard to Dr. Michaels and his lab before she decides to transfer? </h1>

<p>
The consideration, much less the decision, to move in this case is not one to be undertaken hastily or without support and advice from others who are more senior in the department or school. If this is to be done, which sounds reasonable in this case, it should be precipitated by a senior member of the advisory committee, such as Dr. Chen, or perhaps by the chair of the department. By trying to move independently and unilaterally, Susan could be hurting her future professional opportunities. At a time like this, Susan needs wise and strong advocates and should be making every attempt to find such people. Another option that Susan could try is seeking the counsel of the ombudsperson at her institution, whose office is charged with assisting individuals in finding fair, equitable, and effective solutions to problems, and also with providing referrals to sources of expertise for particular problems or procedures.
