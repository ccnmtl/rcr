<h1>8.	Is Dr. Michaels acting reasonably in response to Susan’s request for a letter of recommendation? What other options did Susan have in attempting to handle this situation?</h1>

<p>
Considering that the core of mentoring responsibilities is the simple admonition to make oneself available, it appears that Dr. Michaels has been seriously deficient. To have allowed a trainee he has so little regard for to keep working in his lab for so many years was inconsiderate and unprofessional. However, it would be compounding an already strained and difficult situation to write a letter that he did not completely agree with. In this case, it would behoove Susan to seek out other individuals who are more aware of and impressed by her work to write letters for her.
