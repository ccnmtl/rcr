<h1>6.	Does Dr. Chen have any responsibility after Susan comes to talk to her?</h1>

<p>
As part of Susan’s advisory committee, Dr. Chen has mentoring responsibilities as well. She did in fact see a need and called for a committee meeting, which was appropriate. Considering what transpired at the meeting, and if she thought that Susan had not received the best guidance from Dr. Michaels, it would have been fitting for Dr. Chen to perhaps step in directly and go to the chair of the department to work out a solution that might be in the best interests of Susan. If she had a feeling that Dr. Michaels’ perception of Susan was not well founded, she could have perhaps assisted Susan directly in the transfer to another lab by using her influence and support.
