<h1>1.	It appears early on that Dr. Michaels may have low expectations of Susan, or that he is, for other reasons, relatively passive with regard to Susan’s progress. What is Susan’s responsibility in this situation?</h1>  
  <p> Mentees have significant responsibilities in the training process, and one 
    of those responsibilities is being their own strongest advocate. We live in 
    an individualistic society that places a premium on individual responsibility. 
    In any profession, it behooves the trainee to consistently evaluate their 
    situation early on, with long-term and short-term goals in mind. The trainee 
    should never think that a neglectful, unproductive, unethical, or demeaning 
    situation will somehow work itself out in the long run. When difficult situations 
    arise with direct supervisors, the trainee should seek the counsel of a senior 
    person in the department, someone who has a reputation of assisting more junior 
    individuals in awkward or problematic circumstances, or perhaps go to the 
    ombudsperson’s office at the institution to decide on a course of action. 
    Difficult situations occur even in the best of training milieus, and in many 
    departments and schools special committees have been developed to handle these 
    circumstances, with the explicit understanding that students and postdocs 
    can come to the committee without fear of confidentiality infringement or 
    retribution. Some departments have gone so far as to create special funds 
    that will support students or postdocs when the conclusion has been reached 
    that it is in the best interests of the student and the department to move 
    the trainee to another environment. However, it is still incumbent on the 
    trainee to seek the assistance of the committee. <br>
    <br>
    Ideally, the trainee should have done a significant amount of research on 
    the department and program he or she is entering long before coming to the 
    institution that he or she decides on. Part of that research process should 
    be dedicated to a personal evaluation of the faculty one might be working 
    with, being especially mindful of those who most probably will have direct 
    oversight and evaluative functions over him or her during the training process. 
    This preliminary research should include looking into the time it has usually 
    taken others to progress to degree conferral and/or training completion after 
    they have started working with a particular individual. One shouldn’t be hesitant 
    to ask about the quality of the relationship that evolved over time for others 
    who have worked under particular individuals. </p>
