<h1>2.	Dr. Michaels has many responsibilities as a professor, and he is also running a business. What is his responsibility as Susan’s supervisor and mentor?</h1>

<p>
Most academic research institutions in this country make it very clear in their faculty policies that education and research officers must commit at least 80% of their time to institutional responsibilities including education, research, and committee assignments. The understanding is that academic professionals can work at times on personal ventures - which might include outside speaking engagements or business development - that are in some way related to professional enrichment and, concomitantly, to the reputational enhancement of the institution. However, these outside commitments are never expected to interfere with one’s primary professional institutional responsibilities of education and research, which include trainee supervision and development. It is clear in this case that Dr. Michaels is neglecting his responsibilities to a trainee that he brought into his lab to conduct research and receive guidance on the most productive and enriching research methods and processes currently in use in this particular area of biology. He has placed his own personal professional interests above those of the institution that employs him and, subsequently, the trainees in his care.
