<h1>Ethics Wizard</h1>

<p>The department chair always has the authority and responsibility to call for special review if the situation dictates, and any suspicion of "toxic mentoring" should initiate such a review. However, any member of the student¹s advisory committee can and should ask for meetings to be scheduled on an as-needed basis. In addition, many schools and departments have special entities designated to watch over graduate and postgraduate students to insure that difficulties are not allowed to worsen. Appropriate objective individuals are charged with the responsibility to meet regularly with the students and deal immediately with any problems that might be arising. Departments in some schools will even go so far as to set up a fund to deal with those rare circumstances in which the relations between trainees and their supervisors are irreparably impaired, so that they can move the trainees with funding to other research positions.</p>
