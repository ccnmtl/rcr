<p>In a recent New York Times article, Professor Howard Gardner, of Harvard University, discussed some of the findings drawn from the "GoodWork Project", the ultimate goal of which is "to identify and to promote ways in which individuals at the cutting-edge of their professions can carry out work that is ethically and socially responsible."<sup>6</sup>  One surprising finding in the study was that many young professionals "acknowledged a willingness to compromise their values and to cut corners ethically and professionally to advance their careers."<sup>7</sup>  Professor Gardner's response to the finding was insightful: "We might be tempted to say that they've lost their moral compass, but it's probably better to say that their teachers and mentors and the rest of society never helped them construct and internalize a moral compass in the first place."<sup>8</sup>  He goes on to point out that our society does extremely well at producing highly intelligent, creative, and skilled professionals but needs much more focus on assisting young professionals with the development of their ethical and social responsibility compasses. Without attention to these internal guides, a society jeopardizes its sense of community and mutual respect and can devolve into individualistic antagonism.
