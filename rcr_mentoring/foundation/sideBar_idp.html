<h1><span class="quote">&raquo;</span>Individual Development Plan<span class="quote">&laquo;</span></h1>

<p>A useful and potentially valuable resource can be the creation of an Individual Development Plan (IDP), as espoused by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). It is a step-by-step process for delineating short-term performance needs and long-term career options. Its applicability extends to all professional careers, not just biology. FASEB notes that "the IDP can provide a planning process that identifies both professional development needs and career objectives. Furthermore, IDPs serve as a communication tool between individuals and their mentors. While IDPs have been incorporated into performance review processes in many organizations, they have been used much less frequently in the mentoring of postdoctoral fellows. An IDP can be considered one component of a broader mentoring program that needs to be instituted by all types of research institutions."
