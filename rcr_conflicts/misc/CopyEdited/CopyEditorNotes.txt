Mike:
Here are all the COI files back. I've used the Track Changes and Insert
Comment
functions in Word; let me know if there are any problems accepting/rejecting
changes and/or getting rid of yellow comments once they've been addressed.
In the Core Text document, there were a few things that were unclear: how
bulleted items should be shown, how dates in references should be written.
For
the most part I went with a pretty light hand, but if there was some wording
that just didn't make sense and I needed to understand the meaning in order
to
change it, I inserted a comment.
Let me know if you need anything else. And should I send my invoice to you?
Thanks.
Andrew
