<h1>Ethics Wizard</h1>

<p>The relationships between sponsor and investigators should be looked at carefully. There is a growing body of literature showing that financial considerations bias the research record. DeAngelis (2002) has found that "when an investigator has a financial interest in or funding by a company with activities related to his or her research, the research is lower in quality, more likely to favor the sponsor’s product, less likely to be published, and more likely to have delayed publication." This is an alarming trend don’t you think?
