<h1><span class="quote">&raquo;</span>changes in federal regulations... <span class="quote">&laquo;</span></h1>

<p> Before 1980, the federal government owned the rights to all of the research discoveries of the investigators it funded. In addition, researchers and biotechnology firms in the for-profit sector found it difficult to obtain a license to manufacture and market these discoveries. Clearly, the research enterprise was not thriving. Congress realized that the federal government was not nurturing its investigators and that it was in the public interest to bring innovative products into clinical practice without unnecessary delays. To remedy this situation, in 1980 Congress passed the <b>Bayh-Dole Act</b>.
<br>
<br>
The act permits the recipients of federal moneys to obtain the title to the inventions they developed while they were supported on the federally funded projects, and also to transfer the technology to the private sector.
<br>
<br>
The act further requires that if federally funded researchers obtain a patent they are required to seek commercial opportunities and send to the federal funders reports on how their discoveries are being used.
<br>
<br>
Of course, this also enables universities to benefit significantly from the shared royalties. The act has been a tremendous boon, especially to universities that now encourage, and even exhort, their faculty members to apply for patents for their discoveries.
<br>
<br>
The unintended consequences of the <b>Bayh-Dole Act</b> were to create potential as well as actual financial conflicts of interest.
