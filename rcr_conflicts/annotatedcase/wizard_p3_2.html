<h1>Ethics Wizard</h1>

<p>Is it a concern that the Westfield IRB members have an equity interest in Arthrid? Until recently, IRB members’ conflicts of interest have not been fully appreciated. Even the <a href="http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/mpa/45cfr46.php3#46.107" target="blank">federal regulations</a> have not been specific about what types of conflicts are of concern. I, as the Ethics Wizard, believe that IRBs should have policies that clearly define ways of identifying and managing conflicts amongst its members. Members should recuse themselves from voting on protocols if they, or their families, have any financial or other interests that could interfere with their objectivity.
