<h1><span class="quote">&raquo;</span>Clinical Trial Phases <span class="quote">&laquo;</span></h1>

<p> For approval of a new drug, the FDA requires a series of clinical studies to document the safety and efficacy of the new drug. These studies are conducted in three <b>phases</b>.
<br>
<br>
-- In <b>Phase I</b> clinical studies, healthy human volunteers are given a new drug under controlled escalating conditions to determine tolerance, adverse effects, dose, and pharmacokinetics. Dosages start low and are increased until adverse effects occur.
<br>
<br>
-- In <b>Phase II</b> clinical trials, patients with the targeted disease are enrolled to further determine safety and efficacy and to establish a therapeutic dose regimen. The studies will often simultaneously enroll a control group to measure and compare levels of effectiveness, safety, and adverse-events rates.
<br>
<br>
-- In <b>Phase III</b> clinical trials, the emphasis shifts to questions of efficacy, again evaluating the new drug in patients suffering from the condition or disease that the drug seeks to treat. These are often large-scale multicenter clinical trials with many participants enrolled, often in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study. In these studies, one arm receives the active experimental drug and the other arm a placebo. Assignment to each arm is random, and neither the study participant nor the researcher knows the individual’s assignment.
<br>
<br>
-- In <b>Phase IV</b> studies, after a new drug has been approved and distributed to the public, data are collected for regulatory and product-safety concerns. Phase IV studies are known as post-marketing research.
