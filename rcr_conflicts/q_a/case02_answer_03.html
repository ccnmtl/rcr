<h1>3. Does Dr. Cardoza have a conflict of commitment regarding the time spent at the office of Mayan Adventures? </h1>

<p>
He has both a financial conflict of interest and a potential conflict of commitment/effort/obligation. Representing the touring company and receiving consulting fees can pose a financial conflict of interest. He also has a conflict of commitment/effort/obligation depending on how much time he spends at the Mayan Adventures office and on his institution’s policy on outside work (many institutions have a limit of one day, or 20 hours, a week).
