<h1>5. Accepting the request to assist his chair, Dr. Goodwin, on her Aztec project will hinder Dr. Cardoza's career trajectory. Not accepting may also have deleterious effects if Dr. Goodwin is not pleased with him for refusing her request. How would you advise Dr. Cardoza to proceed? </h1>

<p>
This is a difficult, but not unusual, situation. It is probably best for Dr. Cardoza to discuss this dilemma with Dr. Goodwin, if possible. Or, if Dr. Cardoza is uncomfortable with the prospect of that conversation, discussing the situation with a mentor, ombudsperson, or other authority at the university could help to resolve Dr. Cardoza’s conflict.
