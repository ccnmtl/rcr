<h1>4. Should Westfield University Hospital undertake the clinical drug trial? If so, should Dr. Roberts participate?</h1>

<p>Westfield University should consider not undertaking the clinical drug trial, in order to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest, since Westfield University holds common stock from Arthrid. Because Dr. Roberts will financially benefit from this clinical drug trial if the new drug proves to be successful, she should consider not participating in the drug trial, particularly as principal investigator. If the Westfield Hospital IRB reviews the Arthrid protocol, members who have equity interests in Arthrid should recuse themselves from the review of the study. Also, there is an institutional conflict of interest for the IRB. If necessary, the Westfield Hospital IRB should consider having the protocol reviewed by an outside IRB. To be sure, conscientious application of the scientific method and a randomized controlled-trial design should be in place.
