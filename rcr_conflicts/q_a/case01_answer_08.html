<h1>8. Is Dr. Roberts acting properly in the way she chooses to allocate her time? Is this in violation of Westfield University Medical School policy?</h1>

<p>
Dr. Roberts is not acting properly in the way she chooses to allocate her time. She should discuss her time allocation with her superior. Westfield University, along with many other institutions, allows researchers to spend up to one day, or 20% of their time, at an outside interest, and Dr. Roberts has exceeded that amount.
