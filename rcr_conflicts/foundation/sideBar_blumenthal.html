<p>A 1996 survey by David Blumenthal revealed that, among companies that sponsor academic research, 58% require their investigators to withhold results for more than six months to give them time to apply for a patent or to provide a lead over competitors, a period far longer than the two months that the NIH considers reasonable. In addition, "20% of life-science faculty admitted to withholding data from publication for more than six months to protect the commercial value of the results." 

<p>In that same survey, a third of the academic respondents said that they had been denied access to the research results of other university scientists. When anything undermines open sharing of all research data, researchers unknowingly build on something less than the total accumulation of scientific knowledge. Ineffective or even dangerous drugs are not revealed as such at the earliest possible moment; avenues of research already known to be fruitless by some are needlessly pursued by others, wasting money and time and ultimately hindering scientific progress. (Blumenthal D, Campbell EG, Anderson M, et al. Withholding Research Results in Academic Life Science. JAMA 1997; 277(15): 1224.) </p>
