<b>Problems with the Federal Regulations</b>
		The NIH - which is interested in evaluating how institutions were complying with the 1995 regulations - began a series of "not for cause" visits. Site visits did uncover several areas of concern:
		As the details of policy and enforcement are left to the discretion of the institutions, there is great potential for lax compliance.
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li>There is no consensus regarding the nature or the magnitude of a financial interest that raises concerns.
		<li>Current PHS limits for "significant" financial interests may be unrealistic.
		<li>The focus of the regulations is exclusively on tangible financial interests; the regulations do not address the more elusive intangible academic conflicts of interest.
		<li>There is no policy to address institutional or IRB conflicts of interest.
		<li>There are investigator concerns with an invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality.
		<li>Generally, institutions do not have adequate outreach and education for their faculty.
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>In sum, the NIH found that policies that it thought were clear were open to interpretation. This finding was reinforced by Cho and her colleagues, who found that university conflict-of-interest standards vary widely. It is likely that the USPHS will revise the regulations to address these concerns. (Cho MK, Shohara R, Schissel A, Rennie D (2000). Policies on Faculty Conflicts of Interest at US Universities. JAMA; 284(17); 2203-2208.)</p>
