<b>David H. Strauss, MD</b>, is Associate Clinical Professor in Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and Chairman of the Institutional Review Board at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.  Dr. Strauss has devoted his career to clinical research administration, the treatment of patients with mental illness, and to professional and public education regarding psychiatry and psychiatric ethics.  As Clinical Director of the NYS Psychiatric Institute from 1994-2000, and as Chief of the Schizophrenia Research Unit before that, Dr. Strauss has worked to develop and promote a culture in which excellent patient care and excellent clinical research are mutually enhancing processes. Dr. Strauss created the new Library and Learning Center at PI to provide patients with access to information about mental illness and its treatment. He has developed novel clinical programs to educate patients about their rights as participants in research, to enhance the consent process, and to foster a partnership between investigators and patients participating in research.  Dr. Strauss has Chaired PI&#146;s Ethics Committee since 1994 and is a member of the Ethics Committee of the District Branch of the American Psychiatric Association. <br>
