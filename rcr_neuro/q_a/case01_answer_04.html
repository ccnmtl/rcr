4. Why shouldn’t Renee be able to use the samples, since she is not studying any disease associated with the blood samples? 
</h2>

<p>
Renee should not be able to use the samples because the people who participated in the obesity research project said that they did so only for the purpose of studying obesity, and not for her research question. Participants specifically said that if their samples were to be used in another fashion the investigator would have to recontact them and ask them for new permission and consent. Informed consent means having subjects know the extent to which data will be used. Simply by taking the blood samples from the laboratory, Renee is not providing the subjects with informed consent about how she plans on using the data, which would be for another purpose entirely.
