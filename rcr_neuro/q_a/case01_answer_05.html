5. What other options does Renee have besides ordering anonymous samples from a DNA bank? 
</h2>

<p>
Renee can try to obtain an amendment to the obesity research project and submit her protocol to the Institutional Review Board for consideration. She would probably have to contact all the subjects she wanted to use as controls and obtain new informed consent. Jim’s suggestion to obtain samples from a DNA bank probably would be more expeditious.
