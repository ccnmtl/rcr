3. Under what conditions should copying of data been done? 
</h2>

<p>
Had Banks known who owned the data, she could have asked Professor Hayward for permission to copy the data and software and discuss the possibilities of collaborating with him when she starts her new position. Banks would no doubt like to continue work that she has started and maintain good relations with her former mentor, who would give her a recommendation for future employment. Stealing data would not be the best way to start a professional relationship.
