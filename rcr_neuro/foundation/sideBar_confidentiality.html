<h1><span class="quote">&raquo;</span>Confidentiality and Informed Consent<span class="quote">&laquo;</span></h1>

<p>
A problem concerning the confidentiality and privacy afforded to a research subject and family members became an issue with study of twins performed at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). 
</p>

<p>
A father of a set of twins opened a survey sent to one of his children, who was a twin, while she was away at college. When he read some of the questions, which asked if family members had suffered from depression or had abnormal genitalia, it seemed to him an invasion of privacy, according to the Washington Post. 
</p>

<p>
He complained to officials at VCU, who told him not to worry, because the study had been reviewed and approved, and the study was voluntary and names were kept confidential. The father eventually contacted federal officials. After investigating the incident, the government closed down the more than 1,000 VCU studies that used human subjects, citing administrative reasons, such as failure to monitor research. The suspension lasted a month, but the government required VCU to put in place extensive procedures for reviewing and monitoring their human research studies. 
</p>

<p>
However, a still unanswered question is whether family members of research subjects are also research subjects if medical information about family members is collected during the research. Many Institutional Review Boards are now considering the rights of family members, too, when determining the need for informed consent during studies if identifiable characteristics of family members could become apparent in these kinds of studies.
