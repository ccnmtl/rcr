<h1><span class="quote">&raquo;</span>What kinds of research require informed consent?<span class="quote">&laquo;</span></h1>

<p>
Research with samples taken from a tissue repository in which the researcher did not collect or interact directly with the source of the material, and in which the samples are given in a non-identifiable format, is not usually considered human-subject research under Columbia's interpretation of the definition of research that must be reviewed according to federal regulations, and is considered exempt. Collection of existing data from publicly available sources with non-identifiable material, such as census data, is also not usually human-subject research, and is exempt. IRBs can also waive requirements of informed consent if the research poses minimal risk to the subject and the waiver will not adversely affect the rights of the participants and the research could not be done without the waiver. Surveys of political opinions with no identifiable information of survey participants are generally exempt from informed-consent requirements. But informed consent is required, for example, in clinical trials, or in a longitudinal study in which people will need to be recontacted over time.
