				<p>While it might seem obvious that science and research are about collecting, storing, and sharing data, ethical considerations can arise for a researcher every step of the way. How can data collected from human subjects of research be protected so that private information does not become accessible? Is it legal for a student to make copies of laboratory databases for future use? What should an investigator do if he or she is working on a project the results of which might have national-security implications? This module has addressed such issues and provided resources for more information on the various subjects.</p>
				<p>
					Please take a moment to review the 
					<a href="javascript:openSideBar('objectives.html','360','400')">
						Learning Objectives
					</a>
					for this module and perhaps to return to the core of the module to cover areas you might have skipped over initially but which hold some interest for you. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We have again provided the 
					<a href="http://www2.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/quiz/quiz.cgi?quiz_id=vwo6aaic">
						Challenge Questions</a>, so that you may reread the questions equipped with the knowledge you have acquired and compare your answers at this stage with the answers to the same questions given at the start of the module. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, for the benefit of Columbia University members, we have provided a link to Rascal, the university’s Research Administration System. Once in Rascal, you may test your knowledge of the RCR modules, and upon completion of the test a permanent record will be stored as verification of RCR training. This may prove invaluable, as the Department of Human and Health Services and other grant-funding agencies may require RCR training for researchers in the future. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Rascal is a Web-based application that is constructed to improve resources available to faculty and researchers for information in planning, analysis, and management decision-making. Rascal's responsibility is to provide access to research information for the entire Columbia research community. The openness of Rascal technology will allow authorized access to central administrators, researchers, and departmental administrators at all levels of need.

					To further test your knowledge of the module, please visit: 
					<a href="https://www.rascal.columbia.edu/adframe.html" target="_blank">

					We thank you for your attention and interest.
