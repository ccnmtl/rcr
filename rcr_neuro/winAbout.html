	  <p>Students of this online course learn to apply state-of-the-art global climate forecasting to local environments through experiencing multimedia learning modules led by M. Neil Ward, Head of Forecast Development at Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate Prediction. Students perform assignments using an online mapping environment based on GrADS (Grid Analysis and Display System) software.

<p>Spreading state-of-the-art climate science to the field of global practitioners is a difficult challenge. However, the benefits of putting sophisticated tools in the hands of decision-makers and scientists around the world that will allow for better analysis of data and ultimately, better policy as well as better land and water use decisions, make it a challenge worth tackling. This online course is a first attempt at allowing online users to learn sophisticated climatological techniques and apply them to real data sets without having to be present at a major research institution such as Columbia University.

<p>The online course presents four multimedia learning modules that introduce students to the concepts of global climate forecasting and the "state-of-the-science" process of downscaling.  Students view videos, animations and other sophisticated visuals, and read text in these modules before proceeding to assignments in a customized online mapping environment based on GrADS (Grid Analysis and Display System) software. This software allows students to study the climate conditions of a selected region of the world and apply techniques to make climate predictions for that region.
