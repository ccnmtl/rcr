			The scenarios above sound like futuristic science fiction, reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984.  However, advances in neurology and neuroscience are bringing these notions closer to possibilities, if not to probabilities.  We believe that neuroscientists and neuroclinicians, as well as neuroethicists, can work together to protect people from what might be considered inappropriate applications of novel technologies, but that does not happen automatically.  We must engage in reasoned and informed discourse to decide what innovations and applications are safe and appropriate.  These modules on neuroethics, sponsored by generous support from the Dana Foundation, provide basic information on four fields where significant advances in brain science have generated profound ethical issues.  We trust you will find the modules informative and stimulating.
			</p>
			<p>
			At the first of two landmark conferences on the topic,<a href="#sbar1" rel="sbar1" class="lbOn super">*</a><span id="sbar1" class="sbar sidebar">"Neuroethics: Mapping the Field," the first conference, was held in May 2002 in San Francisco, California.<br />Later, "Hard Science, Hard Choices: Facts, Ethics, and Policies Guiding Brain Science Today" was held in May 2005 at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC.<br /><a href="#" class="lbAction" rel="deactivate">close</a></span> neuroethics was defined as "the study of the ethical, legal, and social questions that arise when scientific findings about the brain are carried into medical practice, legal interpretations, and health and social policy."  Later, William Safire adroitly described neuroethics as "the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, and welcome invasion or worrisome manipulation of the human brain."
			</p>
			<p>
			Using either definition, it is clear that in the face of rapidly emerging brain technology and scientific research, neuroethical issues urgently need to be addressed. Why are the consequences of brain research of such concern to the public?  "When we deal with brain science, we are dealing with the organ that makes us unique individuals, that gives us our personality, memories, emotions, dreams, creative abilities, and at times our sinister selves."<a href="#footnote2" rel="footnote2" class="lbOn super">2</a>
			<span id="footnote2" class="footnote">Fischbach, Ruth L. in Ackerman, Sandra J, ed. Hard Science, Hard Choices.  Dana Press, New York, (2006), p. xiii.<br />

			</span> Many would say that while they support development of disease treatments, medical technology, and basic research to further our understanding of the human body, they are reluctant to probe too deeply into the working of the the human brain.  The brain holds a special status as the core of our selfhood and autonomy. Manipulating the function of the brain is fundamentally different from manipulating the function of other organs like the heart or the kidney, and raises a number of distinct ethical issues. Inevitably, with a deeper and more complex understanding of how the brain works, we will need to examine metaphysical questions of personhood, responsibility, and consciousness.  
			</p>
			<p>
			The goals of this course include a brief exploration of the newest and emerging technologies in brain research, an examination of the ethical, social, economic, and legal implications of these technologies, and the concomitant implications for social policy.   The four modules included in this neuroethics course address issues that confront us with significant immediacy and scope.
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Neuroimaging: Techniques like PET, CT, and fMRI<a href="#sbar2" rel="sbar2" class="lbOn super">*</a><span id="sbar2" class="sbar"><p class="sidebar">Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans measure radioactive emissions from radioactively labeled metabolic chemicals that have been injected into the bloodstream.</p>
			<p class="sidebar">Computed Tomography (CT) scans produce cross-sectional images of the body layer by layer. </p>

 			are used to diagnose brain disorders and levels of consciousness.  Research is progressing to see if and how these technologies can be used to analyze behavior or identify an individual.<a href="#wizard1" rel="wizard1" class="lbOn super">&#134;</a><span id="wizard1" class="wizard">Some believe in using scans as "brain fingerprints."</p>
			
				<a href="#" class="lbAction" rel="deactivate">close</a>
			</span> These technologies raise important questions about the privacy of the mind and how we make decisions.  
			</li>
			<li>Psychopharmacology: Research has improved our ability to understand, diagnose, and treat personality, social, and behavioral disorders.<a href="#footnote3" rel="footnote3" class="lbOn super">3</a>

			</span> The ability to manipulate a person's mood, memory, and perception holds great promise for those afflicted, but also raises questions about the use of psychoactive drugs as elective enhancements for people who are otherwise well.<a href="#wizard2" rel="wizard2" class="lbOn super">&#134;</a><span id="wizard2" class="wizard">Can good brains be made better?
			
				<a href="#" class="lbAction" rel="deactivate">close</a>
			</span>Are we medicalizing ordinary behavior?
			</li>
			<li>Brain-computer interfaces: Technological innovations such as brain implants, robotics, and deep brain stimulation<a href="#sbar3" rel="sbar3" class="lbOn super">*</a><span id="sbar3" class="sbar"><p class="sidebar">Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is the surgical placement of electrodes inside the brain to send electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain.</p>

				<a href="#" class="lbAction" rel="deactivate">close</a>
			</span>  While these technologies treat diseases and injuries, many people are concerned with the potential for future misappropriation of these technologies for the purposes of enhancement and control.
			</li>
			<li>Neurogenetics: Neurogenetics focuses on the genes involved in heritable neurological diseases, and is concerned with how genetics can contribute to cognition, behavior, and personality. Questions about eugenics, genetic determinism, genetic exceptionalism, genetic enhancement, and the privacy of genetic information are all of ethical concern.
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			Scientific and technological advancements are neither inherently good nor evil. Rather, it is how they are used and applied to society that can be assessed and valued. As a culture, we tend to promote the unfettered use of technology whenever it is developed,<a href="#wizard3" rel="wizard3" class="lbOn super">&#134;</a><span id="wizard3" class="wizard">The technological imperative says that if the technology exists, we must use it.
			
				<a href="#" class="lbAction" rel="deactivate">close</a>
			</span> but the steady increase of hype and unsupported research findings surrounding the promise of brain research warrant some measure of caution.<a href="#wizard4" rel="wizard4" class="lbOn super">&#134;</a><span id="wizard4" class="wizard">The ethical imperative states that it is not what you can do, rather it is what you should do.
			
				<a href="#" class="lbAction" rel="deactivate">close</a>
			</span>  Protection of patients and research volunteers, especially those who are vulnerable, must be a primary concern.
			</p>
			<p>
			Because brain research and technologies are fraught with implications about the human mind and the nature of humanity, as well as fears about autonomy and privacy in the face of government intervention, we need an open forum to discuss benefits and burdens and to establish appropriate safeguards as we move forward.<a href="#footnote5" rel="footnote5" class="lbOn super">5</a>

			The technological advances featured in this course are presented in four specific modules.  While holding out great promise for the improvement in health, treatment of disease, and understanding of the brain, these advancing technologies raise compelling ethical, legal, and social concerns which we trust readers of this course will take time to consider. The technologies are increasingly available.  It is up to all of us to use them responsibly.
