	<h3><a name="1_A"></a>A. Office of Science and Technology Policy definition</h3>
	
	<p>
	"Advances in science, engineering and all fields of research depend on the reliability 
	of the research record, as do benefits associated with them in areas such as health and 
	national security," begins the December 6, 2000, Notice of Final Policy in the Federal 
	Record from the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of 
	the President. It continues, "Sustained public trust in the research enterprise requires 
	confidence in the research record and in the processes involved in its ongoing 
	development."

	<p>
	To ensure research dependability, to maintain public support, and to unify policies 
	across the federal government, the OSTP on that day issued, after an almost 10-year 
	process, what it calls a unified definition of misconduct. The policy applies to all 
	agencies and all recipients of funds from federal agencies. 
	The OSTP's goal was to have all agencies adopt this policy. The two federal agencies 
	that support most research in academia - the National Science Foundation and the 
	Public Health Service, which includes the National Institutes of Health - have 
	implemented the OSTP policy, for the most part. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	What is the OSTP's definition of misconduct? According to the OSTP, "research 
	misconduct is defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, 
	performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Fabrication is making 
	up data or results and recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating research 
	materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the 
	research is not accurately represented in the research record. Plagiarism is the 
	appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving 
	appropriate credit. Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of 
	opinion."
	</p>

	"Research," according to the OSTP, "includes all basic, applied, and demonstration 
	research in all fields of science, engineering, and mathematics. This includes, but is not 
	limited to, research in economics, education, linguistics, medicine, psychology, social 
	sciences, statistics, and research involving human subjects or animals. The research 
	record is the record of data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientific 
	inquiry, and includes, but is not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both 
	physical and electronic, progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal 
	reports, and journal articles." 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The policy also addresses how research institutions should manage allegations of 
	misconduct, which this module will address later. At the NSF, the Office of Inspector 
	General has oversight of institutions regarding misconduct. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) oversees and directs PHS research integrity 
	activities on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), with the 
	exception of the regulatory research integrity activities of the Food and Drug 
	Administration (FDA). The Centers for Disease Control, the Agency for Healthcare 
	Research and Quality, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry all fall 
	under the PHS aegis.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Historical examples of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism will be discussed next to 
	illustrate examples of misconduct. Today, plagiarism is deemed to be a serious problem 
	facing academia. Some examples of plagiarism include: investigators during the peer-
	review process taking ideas from others' grant proposals or articles and including them in 
	their own publications; students taking material from the Internet verbatim, without 
	attribution, during write-ups of research; and faculty taking dissertation material from 
	students and including it in publications without giving due credit.

	<h3><a name="1_B_1"></a>1. Examples from history</h3>
	
	<p>
	Throughout the history of science, there have been many claims that scientists 
	have fudged data, which today might be deemed misconduct. Michael Kalichman, 
	of the University of California, San Diego,  points to a few examples: Isaac 
	Newton may have adjusted calculations to fit observations; Gregor Mendel's 
	results with pea plants were cleaner than what is observed experimentally, 
	indicating that he might have changed the data; and Robert Millikan, in a research 
	paper describing the charge of an electron, failed to mention that he eliminated 
	some data points although he probably should have reported why he removed 
	some data in the publication. Others have noted that Louis Pasteur failed, in his 
	studies, to cite that he used the vaccine against anthrax made by a competitor, 
	saying instead that he used his own vaccine to inactivate the bacilli by oxygen. </p>

	<h3><a name="1_B_2"></a>2. William Summerlin</h3>
	
	<p>
	More recently, certain scientific misconduct cases have caught the public's 
	attention after being reported in the news media. In 1974, William Summerlin, 
	working with immunologist Robert Good at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for 
	Cancer Research, reported that he could transplant tissue from genetically 
	unrelated animals without rejection by the recipient animal if he kept the tissue 
	from the donor in organ culture for four to six weeks. Such a finding would have 
	been invaluable for transplant medicine. Summerlin demonstrated his claims by 
	showing white mice that had black patches on their backs because their skin had 
	been transplanted from unrelated donor mice. However, after Summerlin made a 
	presentation in Good's office, a technician noticed that these "transplanted 
	patches" were actually drawn on the skin of the mice with a felt-tipped marker. 
	The patches could be removed with alcohol. When confronted, Summerlin 
	admitted the fraud. </p>

	<h3><a name="1_B_3"></a>3. John Darsee and Robert Slutsky</h3>
	
	<p>
	Two other cases in the 1980s brought awareness of misconduct to the scientific 
	community and to the public. One case involved Dr. John R. Darsee, a young 
	clinical investigator in cardiology at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (a 
	teaching affiliate of Harvard University), who published many research studies 
	and included faculty members as authors on the work although they had 
	minimal or no direct involvement in the papers that bore their names. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In May 
	of 1981, Darsee's associates and supervisors at Harvard caught him fabricating 
	data. Other investigations led to the conclusion that Darsee fabricated research 
	publications beginning when he was a biology student at Notre Dame, 
	continuing through his medical residency and cardiology fellowship at Emory 
	University, and ending at Harvard. More than 10 primary journal articles and 
	more than 45 abstracts were retracted as a result of the investigations.
	The Darsee case highlighted the problem of using so-called "gift authors" on 
	papers. Gift authors have little or no contact with the person giving them the 
	authorship, but the presence of the prestigious names may influence an editor 
	to consider a paper for publication. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The co-authors in the Darsee case either 
	did not know they were on the papers or had no direct involvement in the 
	papers. Eventually, they were found not to have participated in the fraud, 
	having been unaware of the fabrications. But the case pointed to the need for 
	co-authors to have responsibility for information in papers on which their 
	names appear. The case also revealed that the peer-review process could not be 
	relied upon to find the fabrication.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Soon after Darsee, the case of Robert A. Slutsky, working in radiology at the 
	University of California, San Diego, also brought to light the problem with co-
	authors. Slutsky apparently was publishing one paper every 10 days for years 
	and including names of many co-authors to mislead editors and cover up for 
	what later was learned to be a false output. His behavior continued until 1985. 
	At the time, he was up for promotion, and a reviewer noted duplicated data in 
	two of Slutsky's articles. Slutsky resigned, but an investigation later found 
	that, of his 137 publications, 77 were valid, 48 were questionable, and 12 were 
	fraudulent. </p>

	<h3><a name="1_B_4"></a>4. Thereza Imanishi-Kari, David Baltimore, and Margot O'Toole; hearings and regulations</h3>
	
	<p>
	This infamous case pitted a postdoctoral researcher against a Nobel Prize 
	winner. It became a cause c&#233;l&#232;bre in the mid-1980s, and was the subject of 
	federal investigations and congressional hearings, which ultimately led to the 
	establishment of regulations against research misconduct. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The case took more than 10 years to resolve. It began in 1985, when Margot 
	O'Toole, a postdoctoral research at Tufts University, could not validate the 
	findings of some work soon to be published in Cell by her employer, Thereza 
	Imanishi-Kari. ,  A co-author on the paper was a Nobel Prize winner, David 
	Baltimore, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. O'Toole came to believe 
	that Imanishi-Kari manipulated research data and presented her evidence to 
	committees at Tufts and MIT. The committees ruled that misconduct had not 
	occurred but that Imanishi-Kari had been sloppy in her research. An NIH 
	committee at the time also cleared Imanishi-Kari. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Walter Stewart and Ned Feder, two scientists from the NIH who were involved in 
	exposing misconduct, then became involved in the case, believing that the 
	committees and the NIH did not do an adequate job of revealing problems with 
	the paper. In 1988, congressional hearings were held, headed by Representative 
	John Dingell, who chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees 
	the budget for the NIH. All three took up the cause because they believed that 
	problems existed in the way that universities handled allegations of misconduct. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Dingell's committee even brought in the Secret Service, which determined that 
	Imanishi-Kari had tampered with evidence that she had provided to the 
	committee. The hearings were contentious in nature, and many believed that 
	Dingell was particularly hostile to Baltimore, who continued to defend Imanishi-
	Kari.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In 1991, the NIH's fraud division, at that time called the Office of Scientific 
	Integrity, found that significant portions of the data were fabricated. Thereza 
	Imanishi-Kiri was banned from receiving federal grant money for 10 years. David 
	Baltimore resigned from his presidency of Rockefeller University on December 
	31, 1991, saying that he could no longer be an effective leader because of the 
	controversy over his role in the case. He began in July 1990. Margot O'Toole was 
	ostracized by the science field, and at one point, for employment, she answered 
	telephones for a moving company.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The OSI became reconstituted in HHS as the Office of Research Integrity, 
	which upheld the OSI decision. The ORI, however, had an appeals mechanism, 
	called the Appeals Board, which, on June 21, 1996, overturned the ORI 
	decision. The board said that it had not been proved that Imanishi-Kari 
	falsified the scientific record but instead that she was guilty of sloppy scientific 
	practices. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	No one emerged untarnished from the case. Soon afterward, regulations 
	concerning the management of misconduct allegations were announced by the 
	NIH and the NSF; they included provisions for protecting the rights of those 
	who report misconduct and those who are accused of misconduct, and also a 
	provision for an appeals process. </p>

	<h3><a name="1_B_5"></a>5. Jan Hendrik Sch&#246;n</h3>
	
	<p>
	In October 2002, the physics community was shaken when it became known that 
	some groundbreaking electronics research from Bell Labs was based on 
	fraudulent data. An independent committee found that Jan Hendrik Sch&#246;n, a Bell 
	Labs researcher, had made up or altered data at least 16 times between 1998 and 
	2001, and the company terminated his employment. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Thirteen of Sch&#246;n's disputed findings had been published in Science and Nature, 
	the New Scientist reported. According to physicsweb.org, he produced one paper 
	every eight days, with a total of 20 collaborators, who were cleared of any 
	misconduct by a Bell Labs committee. Bell Labs had formed the committee in 
	May 2002 after some concern was raised about the validity of the research 
	performed by Sch&#246;n and his collaborators. The experiments in question were in 
	the areas of superconductivity, molecular crystals, and molecular electronics.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"The evidence that manipulation and misrepresentation of data occurred is 
	compelling," the committee wrote, linking all misconduct to one researcher, who 
	committed falsification or fabrication of data on at least 16 occasions, some 
	interrelated. According to the committee's report, the researcher "did this 
	intentionally or recklessly and without the knowledge of any of his co-authors." 
	But an editorial in the New Scientist asked if the collaborators should have been 
	held accountable for Sch&#246;n's fabrications, since only one of them actually 
	witnessed him doing the research for his so-called groundbreaking experiments. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Also called into question by the editorial was the peer-review system, which 
	failed to note some overt errors in at least one of the manuscripts, such as the use 
	of the same curve to represent the behavior of different materials. 
	But even though the committee said that the collaborators did not commit 
	misconduct, the report discussed the issue of the potential problem of a lack of 
	oversight for co-authors. The committee acknowledged that each co-author may 
	have a different responsibility in a paper, but it raised questions about Bertram 
	Battlogg, who led the research team. The committee said that he met his 
	responsibilities as a co-author but questioned whether Battlogg asked for 
	sufficient validation of the research results, which he, as a senior investigator, 
	knew would ultimately come under scrutiny. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Based on the committee's report and language, the American Physical Society 
	changed its <a href="http://www.aps.org/statements/02_2.cfm" target="_blank">professional guidelines</a> in 
	response to the Sch&#246;n case. The guidelines now include the following: "While not 
	all coauthors may be familiar with all aspects of the research presented in their 
	paper, all collaborations should have in place an appropriate process for reviewing 
	and ensuring the accuracy and validity of the reported results, and all coauthors 
	should be aware of this process."

	<p>
	Given these high-profile cases, one question that is often asked is whether they were 
	anomalies or representative of a real problem. It is difficult to assess whether there has 
	been an increase in misconduct cases during, say, the past 50 years, because data on 
	misconduct was not collected until the 1990s. The rate of overall research misconduct 
	in the United States has been estimated to be one case per 100,000 researchers, given 
	two million active investigators in the United States. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Between 1990 and 2002, the Office of Inspector General at the NSF investigated 800 
	allegations of misconduct in 600 cases, according to Peggy Fischer, the Associate 
	Inspector General for Scientific Integrity, and others writing in the Fall/Winter 2002 
	Journal of Public Inquiry. The investigations resulted in 60, or 10%, of these cases 
	being deemed misconduct. Actions ranged from debarment to reprimand, with some 
	recovery of funds. Fischer wrote that she and her colleagues believed that the number 
	of misconduct cases reported to the NSF was lower than the actual number of 
	misconduct cases occurring each year at institutions funded by the NSF. The 50 
	misconduct cases reported represented .14% of all grant recipients, an estimate that 
	was 100 times lower than the number arrived at from other data. The authors attribute 
	the low number to the institutional practice of resolving allegations without reporting 
	the result of the resolution to the NSF's OIG, even though the institution is required to 
	do so. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In 2002, the ORI reported that 99 institutions had 83 cases of misconduct, with 71 
	institutions reporting a new allegation. In 1998, the ORI reported that 67 institutions 
	had 54 cases of misconduct, with 41 institutions reporting a new allegation. As at the 
	NSF, concerns also have been raised at the ORI about settlements of cases by 
	institutions without them being reported to the federal government, which thus creates 
	a low estimate of the total number of misconduct cases. 
	</p>

	<h2><a name="2"></a>II. What policies and procedures are in place to deal with misconduct?</h2>
	
	<h3><a name="2_A"></a>A. What are the issues surrounding the reporting of a misconduct case?</h3>
	
	<p>
	In 1995, the National Academy of Sciences said that scientists are advised that 
	"someone who has witnessed misconduct has an unmistaken obligation to act" 
	(<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/fhb/app/app_e.html" target="_blank">Columbia University has the same policy</a>). Government regulations require 
	institutions to have systems in place so that individuals are able to report misconduct 
	confidentially and without retaliation. But even though people who report 
	misrepresentation about research may be turned into heroes by Hollywood - as in 
	"The Insider," in which Jeffrey Wigand disclosed nicotine's addictive properties - in 
	reality, whistle-blowers may suffer. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	According to a 1995 ORI study on the consequences of whistle-blowing in the scientific 
	community, "the willingness of individuals to allege misconduct is likely to depend on 
	how the system deals with and protects them when they come forth with their allegations. 
	Potential whistleblowers must consider whether the allegation will be taken seriously and 
	the report treated confidentially and whether reporting will provoke retaliation not only 
	from those accused but also from the larger academic and scientific community."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The ORI study found that more than two-thirds of all whistle-blowers reported 
	experiencing at least one negative outcome as a direct result of their whistle-blowing. 
	Those negative experiences included pressure to drop allegations, facing counter-
	allegations, being ostracized by colleagues, reductions in research support levels, threats 
	of being sued, and actually being sued. Some said that they were fired or were denied 
	promotions. For the whistle-blowers who did not experience a negative consequence as a 
	result of coming forward, more than 90% said that they would do it again. Surprisingly, 
	though, 75% of those who suffered a negative outcome from reporting an allegation of 
	misconduct also said that they would do it again. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Since that time, better systems have been put in place at institutions to protect the rights 
	of those who report misconduct.
	</p>

	<h3><a name="2_B"></a>B. What are some guidelines for those who report misconduct?</h3>
	
	<p>
	People who report allegations of misconduct are protected by rulings from state 
	governments and the federal government.   The First Amendment protects the freedom of 
	speech of someone who reports an allegation of misconduct. Also, the False Claims Act 
	of 1986 protects whistle-blowers. The act, which was originally developed during the 
	Civil War to protect the government from fraudulent contractors, awards a whistle-
	blower 15% to 30% of the resulting settlement in a case of misconduct. The act also 
	provides for remedies if it can be shown that a whistle-blower suffered a discriminatory 
	action in retaliation for the allegation brought under the legislation. There are also new 
	federal guidelines proposed by HHS to protect whistle-blowers; to date, these have not 
	been finalized. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Even with these regulations and rules, how should a whistle-blower proceed with an 
	allegation? Michael Kalichman, of the University of California, San Diego, provides 
	some guidelines for those who report allegations of misconduct: 
	</p>
	
	<div class="tocbox">
	<ol type="i">
	
		<li>
		<i>Documentation:</i> When making an allegation of misconduct, clear documentation 
		of who did what, and when they did it, will provide the best chance for a fair and 
		timely resolution of the allegation.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<i>Rules and procedures:</i> Even though the federal government has minimal 
		requirements about how institutions should handle misconduct, institutions have 
		some leeway in applying the regulations. As soon as someone is involved in an 
		allegation, he or she should review institutional procedures on the issue. A 
		whistle-blower needs to know who should be apprised of the allegation, what 
		constitutes evidence for or against an allegation, how the evidence should be 
		obtained, who will review the allegation, what the whistle-blower's role will be, 
		and how much time the process is expected to take.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<i>Perspective:</i> People with little experience in research should seek guidance 
		before making allegations of misconduct. What might appear to be a serious 
		action could be a misunderstanding. It might be appropriate to talk to peers, senior 
		researchers in a team, an ombudsperson, or the individual in question.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<i>Dispute resolution:</i> Some allegations of research misconduct might be resolved 
		through other means, such as conflict resolution. This involves dealing with a 
		problem as soon as possible; striving for an agreement rather than disagreement; 
		emphasizing the problem, not the people involved; and using a third party, such as 
		an ombudsperson, to clarify issues if necessary.
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<i>Motivation of a whistle-blower:</i> Whistle-blowers should be aware that they may 
		suffer retribution for their actions and that institutions are responsible for a 
		misconduct inquiry and investigation. They should also distinguish between facts 
		and speculation and not guess at the motives of others. Whistle-blowers should 
		ask questions rather than draw conclusions.
		</li>

	</p>
	
	<p>
	According to the OSTP's 2000 regulations, "federal agencies have ultimate oversight 
	authority for federally funded research, but research institutions bear primary 
	responsibility for the prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, 
	investigation and adjudication of research misconduct alleged to have occurred in 
	association with their own institution." At Columbia University's Health Sciences 
	campus, individuals bring their concerns to the Committee on the Conduct of Science. At 
	Columbia University's Morningside campus, individuals bring their concerns to their 
	departments. </p>
	
	<p><a href="#top"><img class="toparrow" src="../img/arrowtop.gif" alt="" width="12" height="11" /></a><br /><br /></p>


	<h3><a name="2_C_1"></a>1. Definitions of inquiry, investigation, and adjudication</h3>
	
	<p>
	Inquiry is the assessment of whether the allegation has substance and whether an 
	investigation is warranted. Investigation is the formal development of the factual record 
	and the examination of the record leading to dismissal of a case or to a recommendation 
	for a finding of research misconduct or to other remedies. During the adjudication phase, 
	recommendations are reviewed and corrective actions, such as sanctions, are determined.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	To determine whether misconduct has occurred, the action must have been committed 
	intentionally or knowingly or in reckless disregard of known practices. The allegation 
	must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, which means determining whether 
	the claim or fact is more probably true than not true. The standards of "clear and 
	convincing evidence" and "beyond a reasonable doubt" require a much higher burden of 
	proof. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Agencies rely on institutions to make the initial response to allegations of misconduct. 
	Agencies also generally refer to the institutions any allegations of misconduct that are 
	made to them. Occasionally, agencies will perform their own inquiries into or 
	investigations of allegations. Under certain circumstances, agencies may undertake 
	investigations or act quickly to protect the public interest, such as when public health and 
	safety are at stake. 
	</p>

	<p><a href="#top"><img class="toparrow" src="../img/arrowtop.gif" alt="" width="12" height="11" /></a><br /><br /></p>


	<h3><a name="2_C_2"></a>2. Requirements to report to a federal agency</h3>
	
	<p>
	Research institutions have to notify an agency or agencies if the inquiry into an allegation 
	of misconduct involving federally funded research leads to sufficient evidence to proceed 
	to an investigation. When an investigation is complete, the institution also has to forward 
	a copy of the evidence, the investigative report, recommendations made to the 
	institution's adjudicating official, and the subject's written response to the 
	recommendations, if there is one. Institutions also have to inform the agency about the 
	decision of the adjudicating official and about any corrective action. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If, during an inquiry or investigation, there is any immediate risk to public health or 
	safety, research activities should be suspended. If there may be violations of criminal or 
	civil law, or if allegations are made public prematurely, the institution must notify the 
	federal agency.
	</p>

	<p><a href="#top"><img class="toparrow" src="../img/arrowtop.gif" alt="" width="12" height="11" /></a><br /><br /></p>


	<h3><a name="2_C_3"></a>3. Safeguards for whistle-blowers and subjects of allegations</h3>
	
	<p>
	Institutions must provide appropriate safeguards to those reporting misconduct and those 
	who are subjects of misconduct allegations. People who report allegations of misconduct 
	in good faith must feel that they can report allegations confidentially and without fear of 
	retribution. Subjects of allegations should feel that the filing of an allegation will not stop 
	their research or bring other undue adverse action against them. Subjects also should have 
	their rights protected, with allegations kept confidential, and have timely written 
	notification of the allegations made against them, a description of the allegations, 
	reasonable access to data and other evidence supporting the allegations, and the 
	opportunity to respond to allegations and findings of research misconduct. Appeals 
	processes should also be part of the system. 
	</p>

	<p><a href="#top"><img class="toparrow" src="../img/arrowtop.gif" alt="" width="12" height="11" /></a><br /><br /></p>


	<h3><a name="2_C_4"></a>4. Sanctions</h3>
	
	<p>
	Sanctions against those found guilty of misconduct can range from appropriate steps to 
	correct the research record to letters of reprimand; imposition of certification 
	requirements to ensure compliance with the terms of a grant; suspension or termination of 
	a grant; and/or personal suspension or debarment. If criminal or civil fraud violations 
	have occurred, the agency will refer the findings to the appropriate agencies. The ORI 
	releases the names of people guilty of misconduct on its Web site. Agencies may also 
	issue additional sanctions beyond those of the institution.
