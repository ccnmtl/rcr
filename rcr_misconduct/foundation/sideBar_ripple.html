Most significantly, the individual who is found guilty can lose the ability to work in the field. If the head of the laboratory is at fault and the laboratory has to be closed, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows have to find other places to work to finish their projects or to start new ones.</p><p>If the perpetrator is a postdoctoral fellow or a junior investigator, other members of the laboratory where the misconduct occurred can suffer even if they weren't involved. The head of the laboratory might be held responsible for the misbehavior, and granting agencies and peer reviewers of grants and papers may become extra vigilant in assessing the lab director's work, making it harder to get funding and publish papers. The senior investigator may also not be asked to speak at meetings. Other people working in the laboratory could have trouble getting jobs, coming from such a "discredited" place. New people, such as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, may not want to work in a laboratory where misconduct occurred, no matter how good the reputation of the place had been.</p><p>The person who reported the misconduct often suffers the taint of being a "stool pigeon." As no situation is ever cut and dried, a so-called whistle-blower might be accused of jealousy or of some other motivation to hurt the implicated party, even if the misconduct did in fact occur. Often, the reputation of the institution where the misconduct occurred becomes marred. Bad publicity can cause students and professors to decline to come to the university. Clinical departments might also have difficulty recruiting subjects for research, because people might not want to participate in a place where misconduct has occurred.</p><p>Even if the accused is exonerated, time is lost at work. The acquitted can never escape from the negative effect of an investigation; it is very hard for some colleagues to forget that although there was smoke, there was no fire. People who are far removed from the accused also can become implicated by association. A researcher who promoted findings that were later found to be fabricated can suffer. In the competitive world of research, people are held accountable for what they say.</p><p>If misconduct is not detected and the findings are in print, the scientific literature will contain wrong information, which other scientists will waste their time trying to replicate. Findings from fabricated or falsified literature could be used erroneously to influence policy or clinical practice. Misconduct cases, however, can become a wake-up call for the institution, prompting it to review policies and procedures and develop new ones to prevent misconduct from occurring again. </p></div></body></html>
