				<p>
					The government has adopted specific laws and regulations concerning research misconduct. It is the responsibility of those involved in research to become familiar with the procedures so that they know what to do if misconduct is observed and can be vigilant of one's own behavior. Research misconduct can have devastating consequences to the perpetrator, the person who reported the misconduct, and the institution where it occurred. Science may ultimately be self-correcting and the research literature may be fixed, but a tarnished reputation never disappears.

					Please take a moment to review the 
					<a href="javascript:openSideBar('objectives.html','360','400')">
						Learning Objectives
					</a>
					for this module and perhaps to return to the core of the module to cover areas you might have skipped over initially but which hold some interest for you. 
				</p>
<!-- old challenge questions http://www2.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/quiz/quiz.cgi?quiz_id=IrZOmOFyOA-->
				<p>
					We have again provided the 
					<a href="../introduction/challengequestions.html" onclick="return challqueswin('../introduction/challengequestions.html')">
						Challenge Questions</a>, so that you may re-read the questions equipped with the knowledge you have acquired and compare your answers at this stage with the answers to the same questions given at the start of the module. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, for the benefit of Columbia University members we have provided a link to Rascal, the university&rsquo;s Research Administration System. Once in Rascal, you may test your knowledge of the RCR modules and upon completion of the test, a permanent record will be stored as verification of RCR training. This may prove invaluable as the Department of Human and Health Services and other grant funding agencies may require RCR training for researchers in the future. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Rascal is a Web-based application that is constructed to improve resources available to faculty/researchers for information in planning, analysis and management decision-making. RASCAL's responsibility is to provide access to research information for the entire Columbia research community. The openness of RASCAL technology will allow authorized access to central administrators, researchers, and departmental administrators at all levels of need.
				</p>

					To further test your knowledge of the module, please visit: 
					<a href="https://www.rascal.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">
						https://www.rascal.columbia.edu/</a>. Please be advised that you will be required to submit a Columbia University UNI and password. After logging in, go to the Testing Center and select the test for this module.
