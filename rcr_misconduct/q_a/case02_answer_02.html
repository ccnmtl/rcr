But personal and financial pressures can push people to cut corners in performing any job, including one that involves federally funded research. Some people might think that they could reduce the time spent working by filling in answers to questions themselves after hearing successive interviewees respond similarly to the same question. Reinforcing the idea that accuracy is important and that work could be monitored or verified reduces the possibility that survey results include fabricated or falsified data. </p></div></body></html>
