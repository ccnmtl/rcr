If it is found that Samantha engaged in misconduct, is Julio also guilty of misconduct, because he did not report his concerns earlier? </h2><p>Chemical research as performed in this laboratory was probably funded by the National Science Foundation. According to the NSF, "Research misconduct is defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Fabrication is making up results and recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit". Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion." In 1995, the National Academy of Sciences said that scientists are advised that "someone who has witnessed misconduct has an unmistaken obligation to act." Columbia University policy says this, too. Government regulations require that institutions have systems in place so that individuals are able to report misconduct. Although Julio probably should have spoken to Dr. Chan when he had initial concerns, there is no evidence of misconduct at this point in this case study. </p></div></body></html>
