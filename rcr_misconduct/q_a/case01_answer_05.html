Independent of the possibility that Samantha might have engaged in manipulating research data, what is the major problem in the way she kept her laboratory notebook? </h2><p>Clearly, after four years as a graduate student, she should have known to write down in her laboratory notebook what she had done in the second experiment. Maintaining a laboratory notebook, which includes writing down procedures and results, is part of the practice of the responsible conduct of research. But, in this case, Samantha was probably concerned about putting anything down in writing about her experience with the second experiment, committing the sin of omission rather than the sin of commission.</p></div></body></html>
