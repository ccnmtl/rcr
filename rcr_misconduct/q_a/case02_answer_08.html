8. What are some of the consequences of Sandra's actions? 
</h2>

<p>
An inquiry would 
probably be initiated at the university, and this would lead to an investigation, which 
might find that Sandra committed misconduct. She probably would be asked to leave 
her graduate program. New training protocols might be instituted at the university to 
train people about the proper conduct of surveys in the field. Newspaper articles and 
television reports might make public the findings of misconduct. As a result of the 
publicity, Dr. Lockheart might think she is being shunned by her colleagues. The 
government might also consider holding back funding for the rest of the five-year 
project, pending an investigation.
