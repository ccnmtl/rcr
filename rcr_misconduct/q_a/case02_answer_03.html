How might technology contribute to the possibility of fabrication of research results? </h2><p>While wireless technology can increase the speed at which data in the field can be analyzed, by transferring it instantaneously to a computer at a university, certain safeguards could have been included in the design of this study to prevent the potential for fabrication. Rather than have the tester input the data, the individual performing the test probably should have done so. Although it remains possible that the tester could coerce an individual to change answers, such an action might become known to the public more quickly than if the tester inputted erroneous data surreptitiously, since multiple subjects might have difficulty keeping a secret even if they were pressured to do so.</p></div></body></html>
