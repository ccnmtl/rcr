What should Julio do now? </h2><p>Julio has several options for how to proceed. First, he should document any allegations that he might have about Samantha's findings. Then he should probably relay his concerns to Dr. Chan, who might follow up with the research-integrity office in his institution. Universities that receive federal funding for research have an office or administrator that addresses allegations of misconduct. At Columbia University Medical Center's campus, people can bring their concerns to the Committee on the Conduct of Science. At Columbia University's Morningside campus, people should bring concerns to their departments. These offices follow guidelines set by the federal government about various phases in a misconduct allegation, including inquiry, investigation, and adjudication. Sanctions against those who are found guilty of misconduct might range from a reprimand to being barred from obtaining research funding for a period of time. In this case, if misconduct were determined to have occurred, the researcher would also have to contact the journal to retract the false results from the published paper about the fourth molecular group. </p></div></body></html>
