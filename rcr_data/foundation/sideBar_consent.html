</head><body id="body"><a id="top"></a><div id="content"><h1><span class="quote">&raquo;</span>Informed Consent<span class="quote">&laquo;</span></h1><p>When a researcher gets consent from a study participant, the subject usually signs a document saying that he or she understands and agrees to the nature of the research that is being undertaken. If the researcher later uses samples or data in different kinds of research, new consent from the subject has to be obtained. A disagreement about the nature of informed consent led to two lawsuits in March 2004 by the Havasupai tribe, of Arizona, against Arizona State University.</p><p>In the first suit, for $25 million, the Havasupai sued Arizona State University, its Board of Regents, and two professors for not providing them with appropriate informed consent regarding blood samples taken from members of the tribe by researchers at ASU. The tribe alleges that they were told the samples were to be used for diabetes research, but, instead, the samples were used without consent for investigations into schizophrenia, inbreeding, and theories of human migration across North America.</p><p>According to the IRB Forum, <a href="http://www.irbforum.com" target="_blank">www.irbforum.com</a>, the tribe alleges that 52 of its members were told that more than 400 samples taken between 1990 and 1994 would be used by the Diabetes Project to study diabetes. Lawyers for the tribe members say that the project, which the tribe members agreed to participate in, was to provide education to tribe members; collection and testing of blood samples to identify diabetics or people susceptible to the disease; and genetic testing to identify the association between gene variants and diabetes. Instead, the IRB Forum says, one of the researchers gained access to more than 100 medical records of the Havasupai to study schizophrenia, leading to publications of the data. Other research, which was published, dealt with migration patterns, the findings of which were offensive to the tribe.</p><p>The tribe also filed a $50-million lawsuit claiming that the university mishandled blood samples from the tribe.</p><p>The university alleges, according to Mark Barnes (Barnes M, Heffernan K, 2004. The “Future Uses” Dilemma: Secondary Uses of Data and Materials by Researchers for Commercial Research Sponsors. Medical Research Law & Policy, Vol. 3, No. 11: 440-450), that it offered informed consent on the possibility of future uses of the tribe’s samples for general population research to study the cause of behavioral or medical disorders, but most subjects consented verbally, and the signed forms had been lost. </p><p>The case is pending.</p></div></body></html>
