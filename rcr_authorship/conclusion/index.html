					Writing papers and reviewing the manuscripts and grant applications of others are vital activities for a researcher and academic. Getting appropriate credit and taking responsibility for work are key issues in authorship, and discussion of the allocation of roles in a future manuscript are important as students, faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and others begin and continue a project. Misunderstandings can arise, but resources are available to help resolve them. Maintaining the confidentiality of material under review in a manuscript and acknowledging potential conflicts of interest are also important in the peer-review process.

					Please take a moment to review the

<!-- old challenge questions http://www2.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/quiz/quiz.cgi?quiz_id=MqvgAzd3vo-->
				<p>
					We have again provided the 
					<a href="../introduction/challengequestions.html" onclick="return challqueswin('../introduction/challengequestions.html')">Challenge Questions</a>, so that you may re-read the questions equipped with the knowledge you have acquired and compare your answers at this stage with the answers to the same questions given at the start of the module. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, for the benefit of Columbia University members we have provided a link to Rascal, the university&rsquo;s Research Administration System. Once in Rascal, you may test your knowledge of the RCR modules and upon completion of the test, a permanent record will be stored as verification of RCR training. This may prove invaluable as the Department of Human and Health Services and other grant funding agencies may require RCR training for researchers in the future. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Rascal is a Web-based application that is constructed to improve resources available to faculty/researchers for information in planning, analysis and management decision-making. RASCAL's responsibility is to provide access to research information for the entire Columbia research community. The openness of RASCAL technology will allow authorized access to central administrators, researchers, and departmental administrators at all levels of need.
				</p>

					To further test your knowledge of the module, please visit:
