Ms. Jacobs contacted the laboratory leader, Dr.			Marvin Frank, a world-renowned scientist, in the hope of developing new skills for her			research and also to foster a relationship with Dr. Frank, who is well connected in her			field of biochemistry.			</p>			<p>			When Ms. Jacobs comes to Dr. Frank's laboratory, she is greeted			warmly as a member of the team. Dr. Frank, the graduate students, the postdoctoral			fellows, and the technicians include Ms. Jacobs in the weekly laboratory meetings, in			which everyone participates in a free exchange of ideas about the ongoing projects in the			laboratory, and which last for hours. In the meetings, Ms. Jacobs finds some of the ideas			helpful but others less so, and gives her point of view concerning the ongoing projects. In			addition, she meets weekly, one on one, with Dr. Frank, who provides significant			scientific advice and one or two recommendations, which advance her work and move			her in a slightly different direction. She discusses the results of her research with her			mentor, Dr. Melissa Seabrook, back at her home college, by weekly e-mails and			occasional phone calls, interactions that also push ahead the project she started in Dr.			Seabrook's lab three years ago.			</p>			<p>			Ms. Jacobs makes great progress during the six months she spends in Dr. Frank's			laboratory, and she writes a paper reflecting some important findings. Ms. Jacobs puts			herself down as first author, Dr. Frank as second author, and Dr. Seabrook as last author			on the paper. At the end of the paper, she gives an acknowledgment to a			technician who showed her several techniques and worked with her on a few			experiments.			</p>			<p>			Ms. Jacobs based her listing of authors on her understanding of the guidelines put forth			by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which say that an			author is someone who has made significant contributions to the conception and design,			or to the acquisition of data, or to the analysis and interpretation of data; was involved in			drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and provided			final approval of the version to be published. The guidelines, which are followed by			approximately 500 medical journals, say that all three criteria must be met for authorship.			Ms. Jacobs would like to send her manuscript to a journal that follows			ICMJE guidelines as soon as possible, because of what she feels is the importance of her			results.			</p>			<p>			Ms. Jacobs gives Dr. Frank and Dr. Seabrook a draft of her manuscript for review on a			Friday, hoping for feedback by Monday. Dr. Seabrook sends her comments by e-mail to			Ms. Jacobs. Dr. Frank sends his comments back to Ms. Jacobs and changes the			authorship listing to include Ms. Jacobs, the technician, two postdocs in his lab, two			graduate students in the lab, himself, and Dr. Seabrook. Dr. Frank also gives a copy of			the draft to all the members of his laboratory for discussion at the next meeting.			</p>			<p>			Ms. Jacobs is shocked that Dr. Frank added the other laboratory members to the draft,			explaining to him the ICMJE guidelines and maintaining that the major intellectual and			physical work in preparing the paper was done by her and by Dr. Seabrook and Dr.			Frank.  Dr. Frank is equally surprised by Ms. Jacobs's feelings, responding			that he and Ms. Jacobs benefited from the input of all the other lab members. Dr. Frank			adds that a graduate student in the laboratory, Lisa Bain, is writing a short paper that is			based on some very exciting preliminary findings, and that Ms. Jacobs would be included			in the list of authors. Dr. Frank says that the results of			Ms. Bain's research would need further elaboration in the laboratory and that a second			paper using the same data and additional studies would be more comprehensive, and that			Ms. Jacobs would be included on the second one, too.			</p>			<p>			Dr. Frank insists to Ms. Jacobs that the contributions of all the laboratory members			were sufficient to satisfy the ICJME guidelines for both papers, adding that the idea of a			scientist acting as an independent entity is an outdated concept and that those who work			around a scientist contribute significantly, helping him or her to function.			</p>			<p>			Ms. Jacobs tells Dr. Frank that she does not want to be included on			Ms. Bain's paper, feeling that she did not contribute adequately. Dr.			Seabrook, who follows ICMJE guidelines but was intimidated by Dr. Frank's stature,			advises Ms. Jacobs not to rock the boat, to use Dr. Frank's revisions and some of the			changes suggested during the laboratory review and to submit the paper to the journal			with the authorship he suggested.			</p>			<p><a class="link" href="javascript://" onclick="openAnnotation('ack1.html');">Acknowledgement</a></p>			<a href="#top"><img class="toparrow" src="../img/arrowtop.gif" alt="" width="12" height="11" /></a>			<p><br /></p>			<a id="2"></a>			<h1>			<span class="quote">&raquo;</span>Case Study 2: What is Responsible Peer Review?<span class="quote">&laquo;</span>			</h1>			<p>			Dr. John Leonard is one of very few molecular biologists working in a particular field.			Dr. Leonard receives a paper to review, about a protein called survivin, which he and a			graduate student in his laboratory are researching. The article was			submitted by Dr. Mark Morris to <i>Protein Interactions</i>, a medium-impact journal, and the			editor asked Dr. Leonard and two other experts in the field to review the paper. The			article suggests a new interaction between survivin and the protein GFX and provides			evidence for the fact that both proteins are necessary for the full survival-promoting			function of survivin in a cell. The article also describes, though, that if there is too much			survivin inside cells they die.			</p>			<p>			But the paper is fraught with problems: poor controls, inconsistent data in figures, and			alternative explanations are not considered and claims are overstated. Dr. Leonard gives			the paper to his graduate student Melissa Zane, who gives it a detailed critique and			recommends significant revisions. Ms. Zane has never reviewed an article			before, and Dr. Leonard thinks that doing so would be a good educational experience for			her. Ms. Zane notes the finding about too much survivin being toxic to cells, a problem			she has had working with the protein, and discusses it with Dr. Leonard. Both agree that			they should lower the dosage of survivin in her experiments; the cells actually survive for			a week, longer than her experience before, and then they die.			</p>			<p>			Dr. Leonard submits Ms. Zane's and his own comments about the research to the editor,			suggesting that the paper be accepted only after a few more experiments are performed to			validate some of the conclusions. One of the other reviewers has comments similar to Dr.			Leonard's, and the editor asks Dr. Morris, the author, to make the revisions before he will			accept the paper.			</p>			<p>			But in the next few weeks the interaction between GFX and survivin that is discussed in			the paper remains in Dr. Leonard's mind. GFX was not a line of inquiry that Dr. Leonard			and Ms. Zane were following in their research. They were focusing on other stimulatory			proteins, but unsuccessfully. Dr. Leonard suggests to Ms. Zane that she add a compound			to the cell culture system that stimulates the cell to produce its own GFX, a method that is			somewhat different from what was in the paper by Dr. Morris that is under review. The			enhancement method works. The cells live for a month.			</p>			<p>			Ms. Zane and Dr. Leonard draft a paper based on the results, which includes appropriate			controls. <i>Science</i>, a prestigious journal, accepts the paper. Several months later, <i>Protein			Interactions</i> publishes a revised paper from the laboratory of Dr. Morris. But after Dr.			Morris sees the article in <i>Science</i> he suspects that Dr. Leonard, who was an anonymous			peer reviewer on the paper, might have taken some of the ideas for the			<i>Science</i> article from his paper under review. Dr. Morris knows that Dr. Leonard hadn't			been working on GFX because it was hard to purify, and deduces that he used material in			the unpublished manuscript to stimulate GFX activity.			</p>			<p><a class="link" href="javascript://" onclick="openAnnotation('ack2.html');">Acknowledgement</a></p>			<a href="#top"><img class="toparrow" src="../img/arrowtop.gif" alt="" width="12" height="11" /></a>			<p><br /></p>			<a id="3"></a>			<h1>			<span class="quote">&raquo;</span>Case Study 3:  Peer Review and Controversial Research<span class="quote">&laquo;</span>			</h1>			<p>			Dr. Marie Rolands is a tenured professor of psychology at a major university. She has			published widely in her field of industrial psychology, teaches undergraduates and			graduates, attends conferences, and runs several research projects. Recently, she has			decided to pursue an area of research that challenges an established way in which			certain worker-motivation studies are performed. The main proponents of the			conventional paradigm are two investigators, Dr. Stephen Jones and Dr. Claude			Marcus, who work at a prestigious university.			</p>			<p>			Dr. Rolands has performed experiments and collected evidence of what she perceives			are the myriad flaws in the Jones-Marcus method. She wrote a paper that offered her			research findings, analysis, and critiques, and she submitted it to the Journal of			Industrial Psychology. The editor of the journal sent the paper to Drs. Jones and			Marcus and two other investigators for peer review. Drs. Jones and Marcus both			provided a lengthy response to Dr. Rolands' paper, challenging her disagreement with			their method on several points. As a result, they both recommended that			the editor reject the paper. The third and fourth reviewers were			split as to whether it should be published.			</p>			<p>			The editor rejected the paper but sent Dr. Rolands a copy of the reviewers' comments,			which were signed openly and forthrightly by Drs. Jones and Marcus. Although peer			review is often considered anonymous in psychology, some reviewers sign their			names to reviews.			</p>			<p>			Dr. Rolands took issue with each of the points that Drs. Jones and Marcus made and			performed a series of follow-up experiments to point out what she believed were the			flaws in their arguments. A few months later, she drafted another paper,			in which she mentioned the criticisms of Drs. Jones and Marcus as part of the			publication. She was concerned about submitting the manuscript, because she was			fearful that Drs. Jones and Marcus would suppress her findings again. She felt that she			could not resubmit it to the first publication, because she knew that the editor was			friendly with Drs. Jones and Marcus socially and also because she felt that the editor			probably had a status-quo view of their method.			</p>			<p>			She sent it to another journal, Applied Industrial Psychology. Knowing that Drs. Jones			and Marcus might get upset if she used and cited their peer-review comments with			their names as the foundation of a revised paper, she explained her actions and the			history of the paper to the editor of Applied Industrial Psychology and sent a copy of			the article to Drs. Jones and Marcus. Dr. Rolands asked the editor if it might be			possible to send the paper to neutral parties so that she could get a more balanced			review of her work. The editor, however, said that he felt he would have to send it to			Drs. Jones and Marcus, because they were the most qualified to understand the inner			workings of the model. The paper was rejected again.			</p>			<p>Continue to the next section: <a href="../q_a/index.html">&rarr;  Questions & Answers</a></p>			<a href="#top"><img class="toparrow" src="../img/arrowtop.gif" alt="" width="12" height="11" /></a>		</div>		<div id="footer"></div>	</div></body></html>
