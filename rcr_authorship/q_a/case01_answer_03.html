What is the difference between an acknowledgment and a listing as an author? </h2><p>Usually, authors play a significant role in the design and execution of the research, in its writing, and in its revision after peer review. Acknowledgments are often granted to funding agencies, to people who provided editorial advice, or to individuals who performed experiments or collected samples but who did not necessarily contribute to the major intellectual aspects of the research. Authors are listed at the beginning of a paper, while acknowledgments are placed at the end.</p></div></body></html>
