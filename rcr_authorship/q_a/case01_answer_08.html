What might happen if someone is listed as an author on a paper for which he or she did not do any work? </h2><p>Unfortunately, in the recent history of science there have been a few examples of people being so-called "gift authors" - i.e., those who did not do work on a paper or did not participate in the editorial review - on research papers that end up having problems of fabrication or falsification. Some might think that being a gift author on a paper just adds to the credits on a curriculum vitae, but authorship involves having some level of accountability for the work. To protect against the problem of gift authorship, some journals, such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, require each author to sign a form attesting to his or her contribution to the article. If someone is put on a manuscript as an author without knowledge beforehand, and finds out about it after publication, then the individual has several options in addressing the situation, such as contacting the first author of the paper or the journal editor.</p></div></body></html>
