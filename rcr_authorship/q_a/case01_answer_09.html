What might have been done to resolve Ms. Jacobs’s ethical dilemma with Dr. Frank about the authors on the paper?  </h2><p>Ms. Jacobs is in a difficult situation, because her mentor is not standing behind her. But if she wanted to pursue the situation further she could contact the ombudsperson at the guest institution or at her home college. The ombudsperson is a neutral party who, if he or she is a subscriber to the standards of the national ombudsperson’s organization, will discuss the situation and will not keep records of the conversation. The ombudsperson can discuss the concerns confidentially, help identify the issues, and offer a range of options for dealing with the issue. One of these options might be mediation, in which the two parties meet with the ombudsperson and attempt to come to a mutual agreement. If negotiation and mediation fail to work, the injured party may then choose to make a more formal complaint with the dean’s office at the guest institution, which would have a committee that investigates these kinds of issues.</p></div></body></html>
