What recourse is there for Dr. Morris if he suspects that his ideas were plagiarized? </h2><p>If someone feels that work has been appropriated during the peer-review process, there might be a way for the author (or a person applying for a grant) to address the situation directly with the alleged offender. However, if the misappropriation seems egregious, the author or grant applicant could seek legal representation and/or  contact the institution where the peer reviewer works. The institution will have an office that will deal with the alleged misconduct. Contacting the journal or the granting agency might be considered, too. Research misconduct will be addressed in another module.</div></body></html>
