Although many journals subscribe to the guidelines of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, many do not, and many researchers do not follow the practices that it recommends. What tends to happen, and how are ICMJE standards being challenged? </h2><p>At some institutions and laboratories, it is common for someone who may not have played a significant role in research to be included as an author. Such a person might be a department head. At other institutions, everyone listed on a research project is included as an author, although they may have played very different parts. Today, certain journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association and Lancet, require all authors to account for their role in a paper as part of the manuscript submission process. The British Medical Journal asks that authors be either guarantors of research or contributors. The guarantor/author takes full responsibility for the published work, while the contributor, listed at the end of an article, is someone who participated in the research to some degree and may not be an author. The American Physical Society also recommends that <a href="http://www.aps.org/statements/02_2.cfm" target="_blank">some co-authors should have responsibility for the entire paper</a>, especially regarding the critical data presented, the analysis of the data, and the scientific leadership of junior colleagues.
