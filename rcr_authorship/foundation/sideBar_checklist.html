Have their comments been dealt with to their satisfaction?</li><li>Have all potential conflicts of interest been disclosed?</li><li>Have all protocols for the use of human subjects and animals been observed?</li><li>Is the literature review balanced? Does it cite publications of rival groups and those which present opposing theories?</li><li>Have you retained raw data associated with the paper?
