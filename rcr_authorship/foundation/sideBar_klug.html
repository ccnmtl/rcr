The prime means of doing this is the refereed journal, and it is well known that the Society publishes the world's oldest scientific journal in continuous existence. Philosophical Transactions was started by Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Society, in 1665. It is interesting to consider how and why this came about. Scientists, then as now, wish to receive credit for their contributions and to win the esteem of their peers, just as do writers, inventors, other originators and creators. While this may not be the origin of an individual's entering science, it does become an important part of the motivation. The system, however, requires the sharing of knowledge as well as ensuring priority of discovery or invention. Thus in the early years of the 17th century - in what we now call the scientific revolution - the method adopted was to communicate with other scientists by ciphers and anagrams, which registered the discovery without disclosing it immediately. It could then be revealed in due course.I would like to illustrate the friendly yet somewhat competitive relations that existed between fellow scientists of that period by showing slides of two letters, one from Christian Huygens to the Royal Society and the second from Christopher Wren in reply. The first slide is of an entry in the register book of the Royal Society in 1669:</p><p>[Slide 1]A cypher [ed. note: cipher or code] of Mons Christian Huygens de Zulichem, containing an Invention of his which he not thought fit to make publick as yet, but would secure to himself this way; which he sent to the R. Society in a letter of his, dated Febr. 6.1669 (st.no) and exhibited to the said Society Febr.4.166n/9.<br><table class="cypher"><tr class="top"><td>a</td> <td>b</td> <td>c</td>  <td>d</td>  <td>e</td>  <td>h</td>  <td>i</td>  <td>l</td>  <td>m</td>  <td>n</td>  <td>o</td>  <td>p</td>  <td>r</td>  <td>s</td>  <td>t</td>  <td>u</td>  <td>y</td> </tr><tr class="bottom"><td>5</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>1</td>  <td>4</td>  <td>1</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>3</td>  <td>3</td>  <td>1</td>  <td>3</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>3</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>4</td>  <td>1</td> </tr></table><br>[ed. note: this represents the code used by Huygens]</p><p>Time seems to run backwards here, because the Netherlands had already switched to the Gregorian calendar, while England had not. Huygens' cipher has been interpreted as the construction of a convex lens out of two hyperbolic lenses. Not to be outdone, Christopher Wren replied:<p>[Slide 2] A cypher of Dr Christopher Wren's, by him communicated the same day to the R. Society and ordered to be sent to Mons Huygens.<br><table class="cypher"><tr class="top"><td>a</td>  <td>b</td>  <td>c</td>  <td>d</td>  <td>e</td>  <td>f</td>  <td>g</td>  <td>h</td>  <td>i</td>  <td>l</td>  <td>m</td> <td>n</td>  <td>o</td>  <td>p</td>  <td>r</td>  <td>s</td>  <td>t</td>  <td>v</td>  <td>x</td> <td>y</td> </tr><tr class="bottom"><td>7</td>  <td>4</td>  <td>4</td>  <td>4</td>  <td>12</td>  <td>1</td>  <td>5</td>  <td>6</td>  <td>10</td>  <td>7</td>  <td>1</td>  <td>7</td>  <td>9</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>6</td>  <td>2</td>  <td>7</td>  <td>4</td>  <td>1</td>  <td>1</td> </tr></table><br>[ed. note: this represents the code used by Wren]</p><p>We do not know whether Huygens actually succeeded in interpreting Wren's cipher, but we see here the rather friendly relations between these two giants.Oldenburg's solution to ensuring priority while making the discovery public, was to introduce publication in a dated journal issued periodically, the <i>PhilosophicalTransactions of the Royal Society</i>, the first of its kind. I quote from a letter he wrote to Robert Boyle explaining his solution to the problem of reconciling competitiveness and sharing new discoveries:</p><p>"I acknowledge that the jealousy about the first authors of experiments, which you speak of, is not groundless, and therefore offer myself to register all those [experiments] you, or any person, shall please to communicate as new, with that fidelity, which both the honour of my relation to the Royal Society (which is highly concerned in such experiments) and my own inclinations, do strongly oblige me to."</p><p>So it began. But because so many questionable papers began to be published on a range of subjects (even a report on geese laying eggs in trees), Oldenburg began to be more selective and to call on more knowledgeable colleagues, and even competitors who were experts, for advice on the worthiness of a paper submitted for publication. Thus began the refereeing system and so a second function of the scientific journal, namely conferring a degree of authenticity on the published paper. Thus the Society has an unparalleled record in promoting the role of the peer-reviewed journal as the vehicle for sifting and disseminating worthwhile science. This matters because I believe strongly that, before rushing to tell the world about a new finding, the scientist has a duty to make sure, so far as possible, that he or she is right. The best way to do that is to expose the finding to experts able to criticize the work. Of course, not everything that is published is right, even in peer-reviewed journals, but peer review is the best defence we have against broadcasting error. Much mischief has been caused recently by scientists seeking publicity for unreviewed "findings" that turned out to be seriously wrong, and the Society has had to devote a great deal of time in the past year to the consequences.</p></div></body></html>
