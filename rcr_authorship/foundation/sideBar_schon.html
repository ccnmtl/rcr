An independent committee found that Jan Hendrik Schön, a Bell Labs researcher, had made up or altered data at least 16 times between 1998 and 2001, and the company terminated his employment.</p><p>Thirteen of Schön’s disputed findings had been published in <i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i>, the <i>New Scientist</i> reported. According to physicsweb.org, he produced one paper every eight days, with a total of 20 collaborators, who were cleared of any misconduct by the committee. Bell Labs formed the committee in May 2002, after some concern was raised about the validity of the research performed by Schön and his collaborators. The experiments in question were in the areas of superconductivity, molecular crystals, and molecular electronics.</p><p>"The evidence that manipulation and misrepresentation of data occurred is compelling," the committee wrote, linking all misconduct to one researcher, who committed falsification or fabrication of data on at least 16 occasions, some interrelated. According to the committee's report, the researcher "did this intentionally or recklessly and without the knowledge of any of his co-authors."</p><p>But an editorial in the <i>New Scientist</i> questioned whether the collaborators should have been held accountable for Schön’s fabrications, since only one of them actually witnessed him doing the research for his so-called groundbreaking experiments. Also called into question by the editorial was the peer-review system, which failed to note some overt errors in at least one of the manuscripts, such as the use of the same curve to represent the behavior of different materials. </p><p>But even though the committee said that the collaborators did not commit misconduct, the report discussed the potential problem of a lack of oversight for co-authors. The committee acknowledged that each co-author may have a different responsibility in a paper, but it raised questions about Bertram Battlogg, who led the research team. The committee said that he met his responsibilities as a co-author, but it questioned whether Battlogg asked for sufficient validation of the research results, which he, as a senior investigator, knew would ultimately come under scrutiny.</p><p>"These are extraordinarily difficult questions, which go to the heart of what we as a community of scientists expect of one another professionally, in the real world within the context of a collaborative research endeavor," the committee wrote. "The Committee does not consider itself qualified to make a specific judgment in this case, in the absence of a broader consensus on the nature of the responsibilities of participants in collaborative research endeavors."</p><p>Based on the committee’s report and language, the American Physical Society changed its <a href="http://www.aps.org/statements/02_2.cfm" target="_blank">professional guidelines</a> in response to the Schön case and now includes the following: "While not all coauthors may be familiar with all aspects of the research presented in their paper, all collaborations should have in place an appropriate process for reviewing and ensuring the accuracy and validity of the reported results, and all coauthors should be aware of this process."</p></div></body></html>
