<p>"Subtle and not-so-subtle perversions of science are very difficult to detect but have very real economic and health implications for American consumers. When adverse side effects are not adequately reported, drugs and devices maintain artificial leads - and premium prices. Scientists may not pursue drugs or tests that lack obvious short-term markets. Ultimately, private science could end up answering not to the public good but to the same pressures that drive stocks up and down."
