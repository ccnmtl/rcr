Sponsored Research, Equity, and Licensing of Technology: Institutional conflicts of interest can be introduced simply by the institution having a license agreement with, or an equity position in, a company sponsoring a faculty member's research. When an institution has a license agreement with a company sponsoring research in the inventor's lab, or even with another faculty member, there may be a bias to accept terms and conditions that are more favorable to the company in order to facilitate the company's success.
		<br>
		<br>
		Other opportunities to obtain equity abound. Equity positions are often accepted in lieu of licensing fees or reduced royalties, or sometimes in lieu of indirect costs. From a financial viewpoint, the upside possibilities are great, with potential returns far exceeding lost income or opportunity costs. Such arrangements, however, may bring into question a university's role in subsidizing the company through lower-cost research programs or through provisions of "free" laboratory space.
		<br>
		<br>
		Endowment management and institutional initiative to create venture funds to invest in faculty start-ups are also candidates for institutional conflict-of-interest management.
