<h1>2. Why does a conflict of interest matter? Why should the university be concerned?</h1>

<p>
Conflicts of interest matter because they threaten the central ethical core in the scientific pursuit of truth and undermine the public’s trust in science. Objectivity is the sine qua non of scientific discovery. In addition, conflicts of interest in the clinical-research setting can be, and have been, associated with injury and death of research participants. Recent headlines have called attention to conflicts, particularly in clinical research, at many notable universities, causing them to change their conflict-of-interest policies.
