<h1>9. How should Dr. Roberts respond to Dr. Bonita's request for the reagent? </h1>

<p>
The secrecy covenant (non-disclosure agreement) in the Westfield-Arthrid contract prevents Dr. Roberts from sharing the reagent with Dr. Bonita. Dr. Roberts should have consulted with Westfield University’s legal department and/or the technology-transfer office before committing to this restriction. In order to comply with the agreement she made with Arthrid, she may not share reagents with anyone. She will have to explain the covenant to Dr. Bonita and apologize. This secrecy covenant would not have been permitted if funding had come from the National Institutes of Health.
