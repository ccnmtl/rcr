<h1>3. What types of conflicts of interest can you identify in this case?</h1>

<p>There are many potential conflicts of interest in this case, both tangible and intangible. The potential tangible, or financial, conflicts of interest are many:
<br>
<br>
-The consulting fees for Dr. Roberts and Dr. Chung if they exceed the Westfield University policy.
<br>
-The combined 5% common stock for Dr. Roberts and her family.
<br>
-The stock offered to Dr. Chung.
<br>
-The equity owned by the IRB members.
<br>
-The institutional conflict of interest between Arthrid and Westfield University.

<p>There are also a number of actual and potential intangible conflicts of interest:
<br>
<br>
-A conflict of interest exists if Dr. Roberts recruits her own patients for the drug trial, since Dr. Roberts would be acting both as her patients’ clinician and as the research investigator for the lupus trial.
<br>
-The publication restrictions between Arthrid and Dr. Roberts are an academic conflict of interest.
<br>
-There is a conflict of commitment/effort/obligation for Dr. Roberts because she is spending time at Arthrid but her major responsibility is to Westfield University.
<br>
-An academic conflict exists when Dr. Bonita requests the reagent from Dr. Roberts. The secrecy commitment, made to benefit Arthrid, clearly prohibits Dr. Roberts from sharing company proprietary secrets and reagents. This agreement was made without the review of the university’s legal office or technology-transfer office. If Dr. Roberts provides the reagent to Dr. Bonita, she violates the secrecy agreement. If Dr. Roberts refuses his request, she may lose a colleague.
