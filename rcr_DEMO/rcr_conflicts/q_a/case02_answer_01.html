<h1>1. What types of conflicts can you identify in this case?</h1>

<p>
There are many tangible and intangible conflicts of interest in this case.
<br>
<br>
-There is a potential intangible scientific conflict of interest for Dr. Cardoza because, in trying to present his data in a positive light, he may not be as objective as he should be.
<br>
-Dr. Cardoza has an academic conflict involved with the review of his colleague’s manuscript, especially if he puts off the review until his paper is completed and mailed to the journal. Even if he does review the manuscript, he could have difficulty being unbiased in his evaluation.
<br>
-Dr. Cardoza has a conflict of effort in deciding whether to assist his chair, Dr. Jane Goodwin, in her own research effort, a decision that will mean postponing completion of his manuscript.
<br>
-Consulting for the touring company can be both a financial (tangible) conflict of interest, if he exceeds the limit for outside salary set by Westfield University, and an intangible conflict of commitment/effort/obligation, if he exceeds the time allowed by the university for outside effort (see Question No. 3).
