<h1><span class="quote">&raquo;</span>Patent Rights<span class="quote">&laquo;</span></h1>

<p> A patent is a property right, granted by the United States and by other nations, that gives the holder the exclusive right to exclude others from the manufacture, use, or sale of the invention. Under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the patent property rights exist for a period of 20 years from the date of application.
<br>
<br>
Patent property rights may be sold, assigned, pledged, mortgaged, licensed, willed, or donated and may be the subject of contracts and other agreements.
<br>
<br>
The owner has the opportunity to profit by the manufacture, sale, or use of the invention in a protected market or by charging others for making or using it.
<br>
<br>
--Patents provide leverage in the market, which results in profit margin.
<br>
<br>
--Patents are a license to file suit.
<br>
<br>
--Products must have a significant (factor of 10) advantage in cost, manufacturing, marketing, or performance to be commercially viable.
<br>
<br>
Patent rights to intellectual properties created in the process of federally sponsored research programs are usually retained by the contracting organization. The federal government retains the rights to royalty-free use for government purposes. [From the University of Texas at Arlington <http://www.uta.edu/tto/pat-def.htm>, accessed 5/4/03.]
