<h1>Ethics Wizard</h1>

<p>Often not thought about in the research are those that serve under the lead researcher.  They are often expected to place their research and even their lives on hold.  Graduate students and junior researchers are the most vulnerable members of the scientific community, refusal of requests from senior researchers can lead to all kinds of abuses.



<p>We have an obligation to prevent these types of abuses and pave a clean path for future research.
