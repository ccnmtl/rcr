What are some of the challenges that can emerge for researchers working in different disciplines? </h2><p>Researchers have different styles of research, schedules in which to do research, conferences, journals, language, ethics, and standards. It takes time for collaborators across disciplines, and even within disciplines, to figure out the best way to work together. The best thing that a university and/or a department can do is to educate and remind faculty, students, and staff well beforehand about the inherent stresses of collaborative research and the importance of early discussion and agreements. </p></div></body></html>
