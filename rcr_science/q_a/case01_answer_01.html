What is collaborative research? </h2><p>Collaboration has been intrinsic to the research process for the past 50 years, but collaboration per se usually refers to researchers who work within the same discipline either within an institution or in different institutions. When a biochemist solves the crystal structure of a protein for a molecular biologist working on the regulation of the protein, that is a collaboration within the biological sciences. But collaboration also refers to researchers working in different disciplines, such as biology and computer science, and between different sectors of the economy, such as academia and industry.</p></div></body></html>
