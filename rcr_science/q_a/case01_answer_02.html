What is a technology-transfer office? </h2><p>Technology-transfer offices at universities identify and patent new inventions and copyright materials, including software, that have been developed at the university through federal grants. The office helps inventors develop the necessary documentation for patents and other kinds of protection. Although the university owns the intellectual property, the technology-transfer office works with the principal investigator to develop the best possible deal to benefit the university and the inventor, both of whom receive licensing revenues. The goal of the office is, ultimately, to benefit society by transforming research results toward a commercial application, such as a piece of software, a drug, or a behavioral-science instrument.</p></div></body></html>
